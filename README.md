# Labs for Exploring, Experimenting, Exercising

*Learning happens in the lab, not the lecture hall.*

The X in [RWX] is for exploration and experimentation, the most important
part of any learning method.
This repo is where I figure out how stuff works (and prepare other labs
to help others figure stuff out as well). I decided to combine all the
languages and technologies into one `lab` repo since they all cross-over
so much. The only that distinguishes this [Zettelkasten] repo from my
others is that this one is focused on code, setup, and configurations.
Zettel (directories) will likely have a lot in them besides just a
single `README.md`. Unlike the others, each lab will have an actual
commit message instead of the Zettel title.
