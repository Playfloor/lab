# Home Lab Designs and Notes

I use an old IKEA Expedit (now Kallax) wooden shelving unit to house
most of my systems. It's left over from long ago (like most of the
hardware that it contains). I like that Linux can breath new life into
pretty much any computing device and I don't like the idea of throwing
away anything that still works well. (In other words, you can take your
fancy professional server-room rack and shove it.)

**Sketchup imports as mesh** meaning that you won't be able to edit the
objects coming in, which is probably not what you want. I brought in
some IKEA stuff to get the dimensions but had to recreate the objects as
simple "parts" in order to manipulate them the way I wanted.
