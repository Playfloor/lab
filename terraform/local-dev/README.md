# Learning Lab: Use Terraform for Local Development

The goal is to be able to emulate complete IT architectures quickly and
easily on a single computer with 8 or more cores and 16GB of RAM or
more, to create an "IT shop in box" to test things like multi-cluster
Kubernetes deployments, cluster + stuff, etc. The sort of things that
you might want to *really* break during experimentation.

We are essentially using Terraform instead of the (old and busted)
Vagrant (from the same company).

1. Install Terraform using the most modern methods. (Don't forget to
   `exec bash -l` to refresh your shell and get the tag completion
   working or use the super-secret, completely undocumented `terraform
   -install-autocomplete`)

1. Provision a single VM using `libvirt` on the local machine with nothing
   more than Terraform.

1. Test using Docker as a *provider*.

1. Become aware of what is sensitive and what is not. Be sure not to
   save files with sensitive data and know what that means (`.tf` is
   okay, `.tfstate` and `.tfplan` not so much). Consider `.gitignore`.

1. Become familiar withe the essentials of the Terraform
   Configuration Language.

1. Create a `.tf` file that provisions three VMs for a Kubernetes
   control plane and five worker nodes. (But leave out all the
   configuration. We'll do that in the Ansible lab.)

1. Have Terraform output the Ansible inventory/host file after applying.

1. Create a reusable Terraform module.

## Gotchas

Watch out for the permissions on the `default` pool. You'll probably
want to create an *additional* pool that you have full permissions so
that when `tf apply` is called it will download the image to the
directory that can later be properly accessed. Such is not the case with
`/var/lib/libvirt/images` (by default).
